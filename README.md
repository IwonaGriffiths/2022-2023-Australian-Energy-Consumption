# 2022-2023-Australian-Energy-Consumption
I created an Australian Energy Consumption Dashboard using publicly available data from energy.gov.au. I built it independently in Power BI, deepening my understanding of the Australian energy market while refining my skills in Power BI and DAX measures.

In this project, I analyzed energy consumption by state, identified the industries with the highest energy usage, and examined fuel types. Additionally, I provided an overview of Australiaâ€™s energy trade, including imports and exports.

The Australian energy market has significant potential for increased renewable energy adoption in the future. Using historical data, I tracked the year-on-year growth of renewables to highlight this transition.
